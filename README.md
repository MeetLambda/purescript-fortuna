# purescript-fortuna

TENTATIVE implementation of the Fortuna PRNG in PureScript.

The idea is to port [Clipperz previous implementation](https://github.com/clipperz/password-manager/blob/master/frontend/delta/js/Clipperz/Crypto/PRNG.js) to PureScript, but we still need to learn a lot of stuff before considering this useful.

At the moment it is just a proof of concept, added here just to be able to share it between people interested in working on it.
